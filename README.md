# QuickUnzip
A Mac-like unzipper for windows

## How to use?
Just run setup.exe from the latest release and QuickUnzip should automatically install! To use it, just set QuickUnzip.exe as your default startup program for your files that support QuickUnzip!

## What files support QuickUnzip?
As of now, only ZIP files are supported since the library I am currently using only supports ZIP files. Though, in the future, I may switch library's. I plan to support .7z, .rar, and more.
