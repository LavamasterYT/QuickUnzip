# QuickUnzip
A Mac-like unzipper for windows

## How to use?
Just download the latest release from the release page and unzip it somewhere safe (Remeber the directory!). Then just set QuickUnzip as the default program on the supported file types!
- In Windows 10: Right click a zip file -> Open with -> Choose another app -> Click on "More apps" and check the "Always use this app to open .xxx files" checkbox, then click on "Look for another app on this PC", then find "QuickUnzip.exe" which should be easy if you remembered the directory. Then it should work! If it still isn't set as the default app, follow the same steps except instead of clicking on more apps, just check the checkbox and QuickUnzip.exe should already be on the list.

## What files support QuickUnzip?
As of now, only ZIP files are supported since the library I am currently using only supports ZIP files. Though, in the future, I may switch library's. I plan to support .7z, .rar, and more.
